# Svelte components compiler

- Ask Server for a Svelte component , pass variables then get HTML
- this means you can write components in Svelte and reuse them in any other js framework later
i.e you can write compnents on server side and reuse them in client code later because you 
get the final html result

# run : 
```
npm install svelte
node server.js
```
